This is a thread I posted on Threads and LinkedIn and I felt like posting it here as well.

1/ If there’s one truth I’ve learned: simplicity is key. Life—and trading—is actually simple. But we complicate it.

2/ Confucius said it best: "Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."

3/ 90% of traders lose money. Why? Because they overthink, overcrowd, and overwhelm themselves.

4/ Profitable traders? They keep it ridiculously simple. So simple, it's hard to believe. Yet that’s exactly why it works.

5/ We expect complex strategies, but the real winning approach? It’s often as basic as trend lines. Yes, trend lines.

6/ I know traders making thousands just using trend lines. Sound like BS? I thought so too until I backtested it myself. It works.

7/ Here’s the catch: you won’t get rich overnight. But with solid psychology and risk management, you’ll be profitable over time.

8/ The problem is we try to throw everything we know into one trade. But as the saying goes: "Too many cooks spoil the soup."

9/ Knowledge is great, but don’t apply it all at once. Simplicity works. Keep it clean. Keep it profitable.
